/**
 * `deploy_space` — commits
 * the working tree and deploys a SpaceDO branch so the preview at

 * files; pair it with `get_browser_console_logs` to verify the preview.

 * Runs inside the ThinkAgent DO and talks to the companion SpaceDO directly via
 * RPC (no round-trip through the busy parent agent).
